# Hi, I'm Elizabeth.
## I'm an engineer, designer, and people-person.

With my background in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and my front end software engineering experience for an early startup, I make a great team player with a wide background. At Cornell University and at Shield Health, I studied and worked as a designer as well as an engineer, predominantly with JavaScript and Vue.js, leading with human centered design first. User experience is always at the forefront of my engineering work. I also have experience with data structures in Java, in addition to experience with multiple languages like Python and C#. 

My passion is at the intersection of technology and people, and I am dedicated to using technology to creatively solve problems to help people. If you'd like to chat, feel free to shoot me an email at elizabethmwardlow@gmail.com!
