# Hey there, I'm Elizabeth!
## I'm an engineer, designer, and people-person.

I'm an NLP Strategist for Deloitte, and I focus on designing, building, and training conversational chat and voice AI products, in addition to being a project manager for voice AI products. With my background in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and my front end software engineering experience for an early startup, I make a great team player with a wide background. 

At Cornell University and at Shield Health, I studied and worked as a designer as well as an engineer, predominantly with Figma and JavaScript, leading with human centered design first. User experience is always at the forefront of my engineering work. I also have experience with data structures in Java, as well as extensive experience with Python, HTML, and CSS. 

My passion is at the intersection of technology and people with an enthusiasm for fostering inclusive communities. I am dedicated to using technology to creatively solve problems to help people. If you'd like to chat, feel free to shoot me an email at elizabethmwardlow@gmail.com!
